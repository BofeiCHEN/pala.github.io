If you are looking for resources about English listening, the websites below are very great choices. What they provide are not traditional listening material, but lectures and chatting etc. You can sharpen your listening skill, as well as learn knowledge about everything.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878" title="ted_logo" src="http://ztnote.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/ted_logo.gif" alt="" width="280" height="53" /></a></p>

TED has innumerable fans all over the world. What it provides are, like the logo says, ideas worth spreading.

The topics in TED are diverse, from " Evolution's Genius" to "The power of saying Thank you". All of the lectures are simple, but inspiring. Because of this, the English in this website is more like that in a class, not as articulate as English test.

This website is VERY lovely. The owners are couple, who make complex ideas easy to understand using those short and simple videos. For example:

<a href="http://commoncraft.com/twitter" target="_blank">What is Twitter and why so many people are crazy about it?</a>

<a href="http://commoncraft.com/election" target="_blank">How to elect president in US?</a>

Do you know about <a href="http://commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english" target="_blank">RSS</a> , <a href="http://commoncraft.com/video-wikis-plain-english" target="_blank">wiki</a> , <a href="http://commoncraft.com/podcasting" target="_blank">podcast</a>?

etc.The way they explain the ideas is amazing, and the English in the videos is simple and clear. If you have an account in YouTube, you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/leelefever" target="_blank">subscribe their feed</a>.

Diggnation is a very funny podcast( if u have no idea what podcast is, <a href="http://commoncraft.com/podcasting" target="_blank">the video</a> I just talked about will be a great tutor).

Every Friday, one new episode is released. This podcast is based on the top news in digg.com. In the show, two hosts are talking about these stories while drinking beer, what a perfect job. One of them is the founder of digg.com. The English in this show is what most American speak in daily life. You can practise your listening and find out what's hot in the internet.

Knol is Google's "wikipedia". Not like the real wikipedia, knol is trying to convert every article to audio. It's a huge task, but right now, lots of audio files have already been available.Just click the "listen" button and enjoy.

If you know about some great websites about this, please drop me an email or comment this post.

Thanks for sharing.

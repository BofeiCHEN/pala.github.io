<strong>pickle mod</strong><strong>ule</strong>

"pickle" means converting a python object (almost any object you can think of) into a string representation; on the contrary, reconstructing the object from the string representation is to "unpickle".

To pickle an object x, you need a file object <code>f</code> that's been opened for writing, and then do the simplest:

<span style="color:#3366ff;">pickle.dump(x,f)</span>

To unpickle the object again, if <code>f</code> is a file object which has been opened for reading:

<span style="color:#3366ff;">x=pickle.load(f)</span>

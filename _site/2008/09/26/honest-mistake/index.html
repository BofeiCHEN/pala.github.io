<p><a href="http://ztnote.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/jiwai.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-527 alignleft" title="jiwai" src="http://ztnote.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/jiwai.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></a></p>

<p>Does anybody find something interesting in this image?</p>

<p>Here's story: At first, I found some news about Pirate Bay and Houston Rocket when I was surfing in Shenzhou VII page built by Jiwai, a micro-blogging website like twitter.</p>

<p>I thought it's funny and sent two related messages using my account. Surprisingly, these messages showed up in that page too.</p>

<p>It's kind of obscure, but deserved a little more thinking.</p>

<p>When I saw the improper news, I had no idea how the administrator filtered the messages. It's understandable that the news about "Rocket" was filtered into that page, but puting something about Pirate Bay, I don't think it makes andy sense. So I reviewred the news about Pirate Bay. It says "A victory for Pirate Bay in Italy".</p>

<p>In order to find the rootstock of these mistakes, I sent "victory" as a whole message. It showed up again as expected. Now it's clear enough to draw conclusions:</p>

<p>The lazy administrator treated all of messages which have key words like "Rocket" or "victory" as Shenzhou VII related. The other  key words for filtering messages are "live", "proud", and so on. I think it's a mistake from recklessness rather than the shortage of technology.</p>

<p><a href="http://ztnote.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/jiwai2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-528" title="jiwai2" src="http://ztnote.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/jiwai2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Computer is just computer, it's not be able to think as human do with some very complicated function like Pattern Recognition. However, the combination of human's thought and computer's efficiency could make some serious disaster.</p>

<p>Here is another story:</p>

<p>On September 9th, UAL's stock price plummet from$11 to $3 in just 13 minutes. More than 1 billion dollars vanished simultaneously.</p>

<p>Initially, officials suspected stock manipulation, but it turned out to be a technical mistake.</p>

<p>The disaster started when a piece of old news about UAL's 2002 bankruptcy, which was published by a website named Chicago Tribune, got increased traffic and became a headline in the website. After that, Google's crawler downloaded the article and put it in the Google News.</p>

<p>No mess would've be made if somebody checked this article and deleted it immediately.</p>

<p>A research firm got the story and released an alert, which was caught by another financial company. This company's automated trading programs started to sell shares based on the negative words.</p>

<p>Either the mistakes made by the administrator of Jiwai or the disaster I talked about reveals the feeblemindedness of computer when it does human's job. Because of its efficiency, computer could make more influential errors than human could. However, it just does everything as what human tell it to do and makes honest mistakes.</p>

<p>Computer could remember every article on earth but not appreciate a single sentence.</p>
